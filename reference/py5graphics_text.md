# Py5Graphics.text()

Draws text to the Py5Graphics drawing surface.

## Description

Draws text to the Py5Graphics drawing surface. Displays the information specified in the first parameter on the drawing surface in the position specified by the additional parameters. A default font will be used unless a font is set with the [](py5graphics_text_font) function and a default size will be used unless a font is set with [](py5graphics_text_size). Change the color of the text with the [](py5graphics_fill) function. The text displays in relation to the [](py5graphics_text_align) function, which gives the option to draw to the left, right, and center of the coordinates.

The `x2` and `y2` parameters define a rectangular area to display within and may only be used with string data. When these parameters are specified, they are interpreted based on the current [](py5graphics_rect_mode) setting. Text that does not fit completely within the rectangle specified will not be drawn.

Note that py5 lets you call `text()` without first specifying a Py5Font with [](py5graphics_text_font). In that case, a generic sans-serif font will be used instead.

This method is the same as [](sketch_text) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_text).

Underlying Processing method: PGraphics.text
