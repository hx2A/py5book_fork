# Py5Shader.set()

Sets the uniform variables inside the shader to modify the effect while the program is running.

## Examples

<div class="example-table">

<div class="example-row"><div class="example-cell-image">

</div><div class="example-cell-code">

```python
def setup():
    global tex
    global deform
    py5.size(640, 360, py5.P2D)
    tex = py5.load_image("tex1.jpg")
    deform = py5.load_shader("deform.glsl")
    deform.set("resolution", float(py5.width), float(py5.height))


def draw():
    deform.set("time", py5.millis() / 1000.0)
    deform.set("mouse", float(py5.mouse_x), float(py5.mouse_y))
    py5.shader(deform)
    py5.image(tex, 0, 0, py5.width, py5.height)
```
